# TODO - FlagQuest

## Ideas
- Make the leaderboards multiplayer.
- Make it so that your old high score is updated and new attempts do not make whole new leaderboard boxes (this could play in with a SIGN IN feature).
    - This comes with the option of being able to see leaderboard history.
- âœ… Added "Next Question" button instead of automatic timing
- This brings up possibilities to do a timed version as well.
    - Select timed version on the home page. (separate leaderboard)

## Complete
- Objective, How to Play, and Features boxes on the home page should not be raised when hovered over (makes them feel like buttons).
- Upon giving the user the stats, the game immediately snaps back to a smaller format. This could be smoother.
